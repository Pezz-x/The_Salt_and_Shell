## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The Salt and Shell application uses a relational database to manage restaurant bookings, customers, and timeslots. The core entities and their relationships are as follows:

-   **Customer**: Stores customer details such as name, contact information, and any preferences. Each customer can have multiple bookings.
-   **Booking**: Represents a reservation made by a customer. Each booking is linked to a specific customer and a timeslot. Bookings may include details like party size, special requests, and booking status.
-   **Timeslot**: Defines available reservation periods (e.g., date and time). Each timeslot can have multiple bookings, but typically enforces a limit to prevent overbooking.

**Relationships:**

-   A **Customer** can have multiple **Bookings** (one-to-many).
-   Each **Booking** is associated with one **Customer** and one **Timeslot** (many-to-one).
-   A **Timeslot** can be linked to multiple **Bookings** (one-to-many).

This structure ensures efficient management of reservations, prevents double-booking, and allows for easy retrieval of customer and booking information.

**Note**
-   We did not go through with the customer model

## üé® Design & User Interface

The Salt and Shell features a clean, modern, and responsive user interface designed to provide an intuitive experience for both customers and staff.

### Color Pallet

Lightmode:
![Light Mode](./static/images/readme_images/light_mode.png)
Darkmode:
![Dark Mode](./static/images/readme_images/dark_mode.png)

### Key UI Principles

-   **Simplicity:**  
     The layout is uncluttered, focusing on essential actions such as booking a table, viewing availability, and managing reservations.

-   **Responsiveness:**  
     The app uses responsive design techniques (Bootstrap) to ensure usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

-   **Accessibility:**  
     Color contrast, font choices, and semantic HTML elements are used to improve accessibility for all users.

### Main User Flows

-   **Booking a Table:**  
     Users can easily view available timeslots, select a preferred date and time, and complete a reservation form with minimal steps.

-   **Managing Bookings:**  
     Customers can edit or cancel their bookings through a straightforward dashboard, while staff have access to an admin panel for advanced management.

-   **Admin Dashboard:**  
     Staff can oversee all bookings, manage customer information, and adjust timeslot availability through Django‚Äôs admin interface, enhanced with custom styling for clarity.

### Visual Elements

-   **Navigation Bar:**  
     Provides quick access to booking, account management, and admin features.

-   **Forms:**  
     Clean, validated forms guide users through booking and management processes.

-   **Feedback & Alerts:**  
     Users receive clear feedback on actions (e.g., booking confirmations, errors) via styled alert messages.

-   **Wireframes:**  
     See the [Wireframes](#üñºÔ∏è-wireframes) section for visual representations of the main pages.

---

The design prioritizes ease of use, clarity, and a welcoming aesthetic to enhance the overall dining reservation experience.

## üêû Known Issues

-   **Email Notifications Not Configured:**  
     The app does not currently send email confirmations for bookings or cancellations. Users and staff must check the app dashboard for updates.

-   **Limited Mobile Optimization:**  
     While the design is responsive, some UI elements may not display perfectly on all mobile devices, especially older or very small screens.

-   **No Social Authentication:**  
     Users must register and log in with a standard username and password; social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) is not supported.

-   **Booking Overlap Edge Cases:**  
     Under rare conditions (e.g., simultaneous bookings), the system may allow double-booking of a timeslot due to race conditions.

-   **Static File Handling in Production:**  
     Static files may not load correctly if deployment steps for static assets are missed or misconfigured, especially on Heroku.

-   **Accessibility Gaps:**  
     Some form fields and buttons may lack full accessibility support (e.g., missing ARIA labels).

-  **Staff Login**
    Staff login sends to 404 page when logging in.

-   **Responsive Issue**
    Issue with responsiveness on smaller screens.
